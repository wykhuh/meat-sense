# Meat Sense

As part of the IntelÂ® IoT Roadshow, our team used Intel Edison, Amazon Echo, and a sense of humor to create a program to give updates about cooking a turkey. We used a variety of sensors including buzzer, IR temperature sensor, flame sensor, air quality sensor, and LCD to collect data about the cooking turkey. The data was sent to the api, that interacted with Amazon Echo so that users could ask the Amazon Echo about the current status of the turkey.
